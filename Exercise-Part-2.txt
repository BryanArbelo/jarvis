Duration: approx 120 minutes

Write a simple batch job that retrieves a CSV file from a URL, then imports requests into a database. 
Assume there is an existing collection/table of clients and requests. 
Ensure that the client ID exists in the database before importing the request, otherwise skip the import for the request.
Ensure there is adequate unit, end to end and performance testing

Note:
Timebox it!
Please use version control, preferably git. 
Add your approach to testing.
Ensure the batch can handle files of varying sizes without having to scale vertically.

Language:
node.js (plus any library or frameworks that you are comfortable with)

Database:
